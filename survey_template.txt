Hi {},

Reply to this email and tell us what you did today ({}). We will aggregate
all team replies into one email and send them to you tomorrow morning.

Notes:
- It should be brief amd only takes a few seconds to read.
- If you send more than one reply, only the last one is considered.
- Needs to be sent from the same email address where you received it.
- Empty lines and lines starting with > are ignored.
- Remove signatures if you don't want them in the digest.

Thank you.
